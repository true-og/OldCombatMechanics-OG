## Modesets
Modesets can be configured for your players to choose from. Each modeset can have any combination of the below features enabled, with examples provided to replicate 1.9 vs 1.8 combat. Players can switch between modesets via command, choosing from the modesets allowed for the world they are in.

## âš¡ Development Builds
Oftentimes a particular bug fix or feature has already been implemented but a new version of OCM has not been released yet. You can find the most up-to-date version of the plugin on [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/kernitus/OldCombatMechanics/versions?channel=Snapshot&platform=PAPER).
